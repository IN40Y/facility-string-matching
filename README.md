# facility-string-matching
This model is designed to rectify incorrect health facility names by performing string matching between two datasets. The first dataset contains facility names that have been recorded with errors, while the second dataset includes the correct facility names along with additional details such as LGA and State. The script systematically compares each row in the two datasets and selects the most similar match, effectively correcting the inaccurate facility names. Note that the datasets are not included, as they are proprietary.
